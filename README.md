# .whistler

.whistler is an Adobe AIR based utility capable of displaying the trace and policy log generated by the Flash Debug Player. These log files are used by all browsers so this utility can be used with Internet Explorer, Safari or even Chrome all at the same time. What ever browser supports the Flash Debug Player, .whistler can display Flash traces from it. I made this utility originally for AIR 1.0 but realized that the log files are locked when an AIR app is running. I eventually forgot about this project until recently. When I learned that as of AIR 1.5.2, an AIR app can read the log files. So I finished this app up and got it out there. This will make it much easier to debug in other browsers besides Firefox. You also won't need to have Firefox running just to watch traces anymore and best of all, it's multi-platform to boot! I know this will overlap with Flashbug, but it's a great tool none-the-less. Use whichever works best for your workflow. Enjoy!
